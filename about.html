	<p>MetFrag is a freely available software for the annotation of high precision tandem mass spectra of metabolites which is a first and critical step for the identification of a molecule's structure. Candidate molecules of different databases are fragmented in silico and matched against mass to charge values. A score calculated using the fragment peak matches gives hints to the quality of the candidate spectrum assignment.</p>
