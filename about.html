	<p>MetFrag is a freely available software for the annotation of high precision tandem mass spectra 
	of metabolites which is a first and critical step for the identification of a molecule's structure. 
	Candidate molecules of different databases are fragmented in silico and matched 
	against mass to charge values. A score calculated using the fragment peak matches gives hints 
	to the quality of the candidate spectrum assignment.</p>
